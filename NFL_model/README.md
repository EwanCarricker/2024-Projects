# NFL Project: Model to Predict Success Against The Spread

## Using 6 metrics, this model aims to predict teams that will cover the spread in NFL games

Taking data from the 2014-2023 season (~2800 games), I used the following 6 metrics to make the predictor:
* Home/Away cover %'s
* Distance travelled by the away team
* If either of the teams went to overtime in the previous game
* The historic cover rate of each teams spread (+6,-3 etc)
* The gap between games paired with a Win/Loss in the previous game
* Teams that play in domes/hot climates going away to cold climate stadiums
